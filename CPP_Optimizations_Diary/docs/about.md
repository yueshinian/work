# About me

 My name is [Davide Faconti](https://twitter.com/facontidavide) and my job is one of the best in the world: I work to **create service robots** at an amazing company called [Blue Ocean Robotics](https://www.blue-ocean-robotics.com/).
  
This blog/repository is maintained in **my spare time** and it is not  related to my work there. Therefore *opinions (and memes) are all mine and don't represent my employer in any way*.

I love C++ programming and Open Source and this "diary" is my small contribution to the OSS community.
